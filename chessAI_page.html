								This Chess AI is by far one of the projects I am most proud of. It uses many programming techniques that I had not used before.
								Some of the more noteworthy techniques I used are bitboards, magic bitboards, alpha beta pruning, a custom hashing function, and transposition tables.
								<br />

								<h2>Bitboards</h2>
								A bitboard is a 64 bit integer representing the entire board state for one piece type. As an example, lets make a bitboard for the black pawns.
								First we asign a number to each board square. Then for every square with our desired piece type we set that squares number bit to 1 on our bitboard.
								Now we have a single number representing the board for black pawns.

								<h3>But why use bitboards?</h3>

								It's <i>fast</i> <br />
								Using bitboards allow us to, using bit operations, very quickly determine many things about the current board state. For instance, it lets us get all pieces of a specific type in a single quick bit operation,
								where as if all pieces were stored in an array we would have too slowly loop over every square. Bitboards are also very information dense, storing a lot of information in a small amount of bytes.

								<br />
								<h2>Putting the <i>magic</i> in Magic Bitboards</h2>
								When generating the moves for a sliding piece (rook, bishop, queen) we need to know how far the sliding piece can move before getting blocked. We could check every square in each direction but that would be very slow and inefficent.
								A much faster way would be to just precalculate a lookup table of every possible combination of starting square and blockers. This is where the magic comes in.<br /><br />

								At compile time generate a unique 64 bit magic number and shift amount for each square. We also generate an array of possible movement bitboards for a given slider.
								<ol>
									<li>Mask the relevent bits that, on an empty board, the slider could move to. This gives us our key.</li>
									<li>Multiply the key by this square's magic number to get an index mapping.</li>
									<li>Right shift the index mapping by (64 - this squares shift amount), giving us an index.</li>
									<li>Use the index in the precomputed array of possible movement bitboards to get the slider's movement bitboard.</li>
								</ol>
								Doing all of this allows us to trade some extra space complexity for a lot less time complexity.

								<h2>Alpha Beta Pruning</h2>
								In order to find the best possible move the AI simulates every series of possible moves and responses up to a certain depth. The generally more moves the AI can look ahead the smarter it becomes.
								However due to the nature of this aproach the time it takes to search grows exponentially. In order to reduce the time taken we employ alpha beta pruning.<br /><br />

								Alpha beta pruning removes possible moves that we know are bad compared to a better move we saw before hand. So if test a move and it results in a neutral state, and we test another move that results
								us losing a rook. We can then safely discard all possible moves from the second move because we know that it ends up poorly for us.

								<h2>Hashing Boardstates</h2>
								In order to save good moves we have previously evaluated we need a good way to store an entire board state. To acomplish this I implemented Zobrist hashing.
								Zobrist hashing works by asigning a unique random number for every piece on every square. Whenever we have a piece on a specific square we xor the random
								number asigned to that piece square combo into a running total. Once we do this for every piece on the board we have a semi-unique number for each board state.<br /><br />

								Due to the ammount of possible boardstates it is impossible to store all 2^<sup>133</sup> possibilities in a 2^<sup>64</sup> intager. So at this point the goal becomes
								minimizing hash collisions as much as possible. The way we acomplish this is by making the randomly generated numbers have a high degree of linear independance. We treat each
								board square as a vector and try to make as many of them as possible only able to add up to 0 when they have a coefficient of 0.

								<h2>Transposition Tables</h2>
								Now that we can store boardstates using Zobrist hashing we can implement a transposition table. A transposition table is a way to store boardstates that we have already evaluated
								before. To do this we use the Zobrist hash of the current board as a key into a dictionary. As we evaluate boardstates we add them to this dictionary storing the depth evaluated at,
								who the board is advantageous to, and whos turn it is. Then the whenever we try to evaluate a boardstate we first check if we have already evaluated it. If we have then we can skip
								doing a large amount of expensive calculations.
