							<p>
								Refraction is one of my favorite and one of the most challenging projects I've worked on yet. Due to the contraints of the assignment I had to write the entire lighting engine on the cpu.
								In order to make it as preformant as it is, I had to do a lot of low level optimization. While looking at the memory used I realised that it was very cashe incoherant, in order to fix this
								I made my own custom datatype for colors. This allowed them to be as small as possible so they could fit in the cashe. Another optimization I did was multi-threading the lighting calculations.
								With threads able to take a set of pixels and solve them in parallel, the program ran much more efficiently.<br />

								<h3>How it works:</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>All objects and tilesets are merged together into one image (the normal maps are also merged into a seperate image).</li>
									<li>For each light we then go over each pixel in its range and calcuate the lights strength, using the normal map to factor in the surface normal.</li>
									<li>The individual lights strength are added together resulting in the total brightness.</li>
									<li>We then apply any post prossessing effects, like dithering and scanlines.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>Preformatted</h3>
								<pre><code>i = 0;

while (!deck.isInOrder()) {
    print 'Iteration ' + i;
    deck.shuffle();
    i++;
}

print 'It took ' + i + ' iterations to sort the deck.';</code></pre>
